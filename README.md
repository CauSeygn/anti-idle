# Anti-Idle: The Game Godot port
Original game made by Tukkun with contributions from many others.

The intention is to port the game from ActionScript to a more modern language and programming engine, so more people can edit the game's code to their needs, and allow for the game to be playable outside of the antiquated Adobe Flash platform.

Navigation of the repository is outlined below:

## Addons
Godot addons for testing

## Decompile

## Fonts
